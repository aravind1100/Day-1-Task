Question : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

* HTTP/1.1 was first used in 1997 after several stages of development.Although
  users had several problems in using it.To overcome this issue, HTTP/2 was 
  launched on 2015.

Differences :

    1.Major problem in HTTP/1.1 was it took lot of time to load the contents
      in the web page as the priority of loading the contents are not in
      the efficient order. Ex. If a user is at the top of the page,the contents
      at the bottom of the page loading at first affets the web performance.
      
    2.HTTP/2 solved this problem by loading the contents in an efficient manner.
      Such that,if a user is at the top of the page,the contents in the top of 
      the page such as headings,titles,images are loaded first for the user.

    3.So,HTTP/1.1 took more time to load and HTTP/2 took less time than HTTP 1 
      and became more user friendly.      

    4.HTTP/1.1 works on the textual format and HTTP/2 works on 
      the binary protocol.

    5.HTTP/2 compressed the small files faster and better than the HTTP/1 by
      using the advanced compression method called HPACK.Hence,resulted in
      better web performance.

    6.HTTP/1.1 loads the contents one after the another,if a resource doesn't work 
      then it blocks the resources after it.HTTP/2 solved this problem by using
      TCP connection.So,that no resource blocks the other resource.
