Question : Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects :

    * An object is a complex data type in Javascript which is an unordered collection
      of related data stored in "key:value" pairs.
      Example: const car = {color:"White",engine:"Diesel"}

    * The "keys" can be a variable or a function and the values assigned
      to a key can only be accessed with the key names.
      Example: Object_Name.key_name

    * The objects have several properties and methods by which we can 
      manipulate the data in it.
